# html-css-snippets

A collection of reusable HTML and CSS components built with simplicity and clarity in mind — inspired by the W3C's "How to" tutorials for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository serves as a personal library of clean, accessible, and lightweight UI components that can be quickly integrated into any web project. All components are built using vanilla HTML and CSS, with minimal or no JavaScript, following best practices and web standards.

✨ Ideal for learning, rapid prototyping, or starting a project with no frameworks.
